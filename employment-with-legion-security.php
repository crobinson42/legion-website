            </h5>

            <p class="txt-light">
              At Legion Security every employee is dependent on his or her fellow employees to work together and contribute to the team. No employee can work alone; our officers work together and willingly take the help of their colleagues to accomplish our security tasks efficiently.
              <br><br>
              At Legion Security we believe that when working within a team it's important to keep a good line of communication open. When you have good communication then you also have the ability to resolve problems together. Effective communication allows a team to bring together different opinions and points of view for brainstorming in a positive and healthy manner.

              <br><br>
              <strong>“Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success"</strong>

              At Legion Security we believe that managers should always have an exit strategy. Because when they get promoted or move on to a new position, there should be a plan in place for their departure—including a solid suggestion for someone to fill their role. And that means we need to be preparing all of our employees for leadership now.
              <br>
              <br>
              Of course, it isn’t all about the managers. At Legion Security we believe it is important to instill leadership and professional skills in all of our employees for the good of their careers, too. When they’re equipped with management skills, they’ll be able to make informed decisions, guide their peers and be better qualified for opportunities that come their way.

            <p class="txt-light">
              Whether you want to pursue a career in the Security Industry or simply desire to gain experience on your way to another chosen career, you need to ask yourself… Where would you like to be in one year? In five years? What experiences will help you achieve that? What interests and skills would you like to use in your career? Setting a career goal is about deciding where you want to head in your career, and noting the steps needed to reach that point.  At Legion Security we understand that not everyone is in this job for a career.  Our goal is to help dedicated, loyal and hardworking employees to achieve whatever their career goals are. For those interested in the Security Industry as a career, we offer advancement and training opportunities.  For those pursuing other interests, we offer mentoring and assistance to help you along the way in your pursuits.
