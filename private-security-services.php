            <p>
              <h5>What are security patrol services?</h5>

              Security Patrol services is also well-known as vehicle security patrol based service. Patrol or vehicle services can be a strong deterrent to crime and provide a number of valuable services, such as alarm response, after-hours control of locks and gates, and periodic inspection of key locations. It helps to make possible to identify areas that need attention. With security patrol service the possibility of something bad happening to a client property can be dealt positively.

              <h5>How Security Patrol Services work for security? </h5>

              Patrol officers and vehicles are out 24/7 a day for the security of the area where they appointed. Patrol officers are well skilled to notice any mistrustful activity so they can put off a problem before it starts. Their security vehicles are equipped with GPS tracking devices so you will know accurately when your officers are onsite and for how long. A security patrol service includes electronic reporting systems which provide real time reports of any issues or incidents if found and corrective measures can be taken. This 24 hour dispatch also provides immediate police and supervisory response to emergency situations and provides the continuous safety to people and property.

              <h5>Benefits</h5>
              Legion Security supports your camera security plan at a lower cost than on-site monitoring. Rates are based on the number of cameras and can be an affordable alternative to maintaining staff on site to monitor your feed. With Legion Security monitoring services, your building is never unattended and anyone on premises is never alone. Regardless of whether there is a guard on duty in your building, the feed is being monitored, and you can be assured that your people, your premises and your property are safe.
              <br>
              <br>
              Legion Security monitoring of a camera feed is the ideal security solution for after hours and restricted access areas. Cameras can be watched constantly.  The responding security officer on duty is alerted only if movement is detected in an area where there should not be any, creating an even greater savings on your security services. This is an ideal application for after hours when your facility is closed or overnight shifts on construction sites.
