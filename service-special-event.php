                 <p>
                   Most events require bag searching for outside food/drinks, contraband, alcohol, and dangerous items such as knives. Legion provides tables, cones, metal detectors, and the staff to handle your event entrance.

                 <p>
                   When your event cashiers are receiving more cash then can fit in their register, you need an Armed Legion Security Officer to escort. We'll provide a foot or vehicle escort with your staff to ensure they follow your procedures for depositing or turning in their cash drawer.

                 <p>
                   Every special event has a parking lot with a ton of cars. There's nothing worse than your patrons having their cars vandalized or even worse, broken into. Legion will provide a parking lot security detail that patrols on foot, bike, or ATV to ensure your parking lot is safe. We'll even bring cones and traffic devices to assist.
                   <br/>

                 <p>
                   Staying in contact with your event security team is important. All Legion event security officers are equipped with walkie-talkie radios for quick communication. You and your staff will receive radios to quickly get in contact with the event security supervisor should a problem arise.

                 <p>
                   When the concert's main event is about to arrive, Legion VIP detail is there for you and your guest star. We've dealt with the big stars and the rowdy crowds, we're ready to make your event a smooth and great memory for your performance artists.

                 <p>
                   Legion security staff receive ID training and are able to spot a false/fake ID. When your event is serving alcohol, we know how important it is to ensure only patrons over the drinking age are in posession of alcohol.
