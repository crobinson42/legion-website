            Our patrol service is typically contracted to patrol your property for a
            set number of patrols per 24 hours (each day of the month). Our patrol service
            operates 365/24/7, including all holidays, so you never have to worry about
            not being covered.

          <p style="font-weight:600;">
            During each patrol visit, the Patrol Officer gets out of their  vehicle
            and walks the property, physically inspecting areas, doors, & facilities.

                Legion patrol officers patrol a specific area for our client on private property. Our patrol activities are concentrated on proactive measures rather than reactive. The sight of a patrol vehicle acts as a great deterrent to criminal activity

                Legion patrol officers do not always patrol in the same predictable pattern. We create alternating patrol times and patrol patterns every night for a more sporadic and unpredictable security presence. The bad guy will never know when or where security is going to be.

                Legion patrol officers obey all traffic and state laws. If they observe something suspicious, the patrol officer will address the activity and report it using the appropriate methods. When driving at night, our patrol officers use spot lights and flashing overhead lights as needed for presence or to address an incident

                Legion patrol officers are equipped with a laptop and 2-way radio to communicate with our Dispatch Center. When Legion Dispatch receives a call from a client he/she then forwards the information to the appropriate patrol officer and the patrol officer responds. Following every patrol visit or incident response, our patrol officer completes a detailed report using our online reporting system.

                Every Legion Security Patrol Officer completes a detailed report of his/her duties while on client property. Our client then receives an automatically emailed report of the security officer’s activities and findings during their shift or response.

                Waiting for something to happen and responding is so 1999. Legion Security Patrol Officers care about their job and our clients - which means our clients can expect a very proactive approach to our patrols. We don't wait for the problems to happen, we prevent them from happening.

            LEGION Security never uses personal, compact nor any other sub-standard security vehicles.  All of our patrol vehicles are full-size and fully equipped late model FORD police-type vehicles.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-center">
            All LEGION patrol vehicles are equipped with emergency lighting and communications systems as well as 24-hour GPS tracking systems.  When we are on your property, we are flashing overhead lights to send a clear message that we are on scene and we take the protection of your facility seriously.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-center">
            All of our vehicles have the full LEGION graphic designs that have become a very familiar sight on the streets and highways around the greater Sacramento area.  When you see those familiar LEGION vehicles on the streets, you know that this is a company that means business.

            LEGION offers specialized vehicle patrol services to property management companies, commercial businesses and government facilities.  We provide advanced security solutions and peace of mind through effective security patrols within your community.

            <br />
            <p class="text-center">
            Policing is now reactive, rather than a proactive service, due to the high volume of calls for service, increases in population, and fewer officers on the street to respond to the demand.  Police response times have increased while their ability to patrol communities has diminished due to the ongoing strain on their resources.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-5">
            <p class="text-center">
            LEGION patrol officers can bridge the gap caused by a lack of police presence and response by providing a 24 hour patrol service to safeguard you and your assets. We will challenge and document any suspicious persons or activities in the area, act on and report criminal activities while providing a continuous safety and emergency response service to you, your employees, your residents or your customers.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-center">
            When you call the LEGION Security Dispatch Center, you will never get a telephone answering machine or answering service.  You will never get an out-of-town or “National” call center person who doesn’t know the difference between Sacramento and Citrus Heights.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-center">
            LEGION Security never sub-contracts or provides off-duty guards.  All LEGION security officers are full-duty, fully-trained, fully-licensed and dressed in full, distinctive and professional LEGION security uniforms.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-center">
            Our patrol officers will respond immediately to any concern or complaint reported, addressing the concern with professionalism and vigilance. We provide an immediate, first line of defense and will be available to respond to any emergency within minutes to protect you and your property until Police, Fire or EMS response is available.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="text-center">
            Our patrol officers are experienced security professionals who will work closely with the police to ensure ongoing client safety and peace of mind. Private patrols are an affordable and effective means of establishing and ensuring a safer community, commercial center or government facility.
