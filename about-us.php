              Legion Security strictly requires it's staff to be on-time, in the
              appropriate uniform, and perform the required duties for the assignment.
              While some understand strictness as having no tolerence for error or
              mistakes, we take more of a true leadership approach to our team.
              You can only grow as a team member with Legion if you are willing
              to correct your mistakes when counseled and give the effort to do
              your best.
