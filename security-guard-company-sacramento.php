        </h1>

        <p class="text-center">
          Hiring LEGION security has many benefits.  At the most basic level, the presence of a professional LEGION security officer can be enough to deter a thief.  This is because our security officers communicate to thieves that their chosen target will not be an easy one.  As well, LEGION Security Officers are trained to spot potentially threatening behavior, meaning a higher chance of that behavior being curbed before it even becomes a problem.

        </p>

        <br/>

        <p class="text-center">
          Another benefit is that a LEGION Security Officer can react right away if there is trouble afoot.  Unlike a security camera, which simply records security breaches, our security officers can address problems immediately.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p class="text-center">
          Even having access to LEGION Security’s Dispatch phone number can be enough to defuse situations when they arise during working hours.  There is little more effective than saying "I’m going to call security" when a situation looks like it’s going to get out of control.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p class="text-center">
