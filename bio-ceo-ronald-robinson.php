          Ron started his career as a security officer with a small company in Sacramento, CA.  In this position he quickly gained comprehensive experience in the Private Security Industry.  Honing his skills in the duties and responsibilities of security officers as well as becoming extremely well versed in the authority, liabilities and pitfalls of security personnel, he quickly rose through the ranks to a supervisory position.
          <br />
          <br />
          In his position as a security officer, Ron worked closely with Apartment Management and leasing personnel. Through these connections he decided to follow another passion and pursue a position in the Sacramento apartment rental industry.  He then went on to become a Leasing Agent working for a large property management company at an apartment complex in South Sacramento.  This was an excellent starting point for him, because Ron was given the rare opportunity to participate in the lease-up of a property, which had over 90% of its 356 units at the 60% median income level.
          <br />
          <br />
          During Ron’s period as a leasing consultant, he quickly learned all of the intricacies of this new career field. Always a people person, Ron maintained high leasing ratios, assisted the on-site management team in establishing rapport with new residents and quickly became an integral part of a very professional team of management and leasing personnel with one of Sacramento’s premier management companies.  During this time Ron proved to be an outstanding and natural problem solver who always showed great compassion for his residents.  He has an intimate understanding of the needs and requirements of both the property owner and the tenant.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once having mastered the skills of Property Management, Ron returned to the security industry to serve as the Business Operations Manager for a mid-sized security company in Sacramento.  He quickly became expert in insurance requirements, Labor Laws, payroll and budgeting, The Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) Bureau of Security and Investigative Services (BSIS) regulations and all of the legal requirements to operate a security company.  In this position, he insured all administrative functions of a quickly growing and successful security company were met while ensuring operations were run as cost effectively and efficient as possible.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2015 Ron earned his own Private Patrol Operator (PPO) license.  Based on his vast experience both in the Private Security Industry and in the property management industry, it only made sense to blend the two in order to create a security company that completely understands and is capable of dealing with the problems and needs of property managers.  Legion Security is born!
