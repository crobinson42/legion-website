        <h6>Research</h6>
        <p>
          Research has shown that having security personnel on a property, or patrolling through a community, can act as a way to deter crime. If you were a would-be thief or vandal, would you choose to target a property that was under surveillance? The answer is likely no. Hiring a trained professional to operate a gatehouse, patrol a community, or work a front desk, is a great way to send a message that there is no tolerance to vandalism or any other type of criminal behavior. Having an actual person working as a security guard will act as a greater deterrent than just having video surveillance on your property.

        <h6>Our Solution</h6>
        <p>
          For smaller communities or management working with a thin budget, we recommend
          our Random Vehicle Patrol Service. It's extremely effective at showing
          a presence not only with a security vehicle arriving and leaving several
          times, randomly, but the Legion Security Officer that gets out of his
          patrol car and walks your property showing his presence.
