          Facility Access and Camera Monitoring
        </h1>

        <p class="text-center">
          When your property is protected by traditional cameras, a CCTV system is only as good as its program of monitoring and response. Legion Security maintains a camera monitoring program which allows our clients to optimize the function and cost-effectiveness of their CCTV and other surveillance systems by having their camera feed tracked 24/7 by dedicated monitoring personnel. In the event of suspicious or unusual activity, our Dispatch Center personnel immediately alert our management, on-site security and the proper authorities (police, fire or medical), to ensure the quick response needed to protect your people and property.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p class="text-center">
          Remote Monitoring is known to be one of the most effective and convenient solutions. Why?  This allows you to oversee and safeguard your assets even when you are not present.  Even the most out of the way sites can be protected with LEGION’s high-tech camera systems.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p class="text-center bg-warning">
          Economy – Guards cost a lot of money, a video monitoring service using state of the art commercial camera systems can save up to 70% over the cost of just one live guard.

          Benefits of Legion Security Camera Monitoring
        </h3>

        <p class="text-center">
          Legion Security supports your CCTV security plan at a lower cost than on-site monitoring. Rates are based on the number of cameras and can be an affordable alternative to maintaining staff on site to monitor your feed. With Legion Security monitoring services, your building is never unattended and anyone on premises is never alone. Regardless of whether there is a guard on duty in your building, the feed is being monitored, and you can be assured that your people, your premises and your property are safe.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p class="text-center">
          Legion Security monitoring of a CCTV feed is the ideal security solution for after hours and restricted access areas. Cameras can be watched constantly.  The responding security officer on duty is alerted only if movement is detected in an area where there should not be any, creating an even greater savings on your security services. This is an ideal application for after hours when your facility is closed or overnight shifts on construction sites.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p class="text-center">
          Legion Security specializes in pro-actively protecting businesses and investments during hours of vulnerability.  We offer unique surveillance services that can easily and covertly replace dedicated standing or patrol security officers with affordable and highly effective, state of the art virtual security.
